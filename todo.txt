-hp bar under enemy (these 2 are separated
-atack patterns (IE: function "enemybehaviour that makes the enemy chose a random action (can
	be more or less favoured to do something IE: low hp : atack more) and chain animations and states accordingly)

-map design
-screen scrolling (look up how to move camera sdl)
-cooler laze for the player (thicker and cool design maybe top)

-screen scaling to a sensible resolution (lookup resolutions for consoles)
-if you are gonna scale the screen it might be a good idea to make every single scaling 
 depend on the screen resolution
